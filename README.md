```

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script with the appropriate parameters:

- To get logs for a specific user:

```
python3 main.py --getlogs \
--starttime 2024-10-04-08-00-00 \
--endtime 2024-10-04-10-00-00 \
--workspaceid b152f67b-5678-408f-b708-8943264822d6,18328920-8765-4521-9aa5-2fe0aaec1c6b \
--useremail user@domain.com
```

- To delete logs for a specific user:

```
python3 main.py --deletelogs \
--starttime 2024-10-04-08-00-00 \

--subscriptionid 0e121138-80e8-1234-bacc-c7e0b3cd8aa \
--workspace workspace-name \
--resourcegroup rg-test \
--useremail user@domain.com
```
The purge request will be submitted and the purge ID will be saved to a file named `purgeid.txt`.

- To get the status of a purge request:

```
python3 main.py --status \
--subscriptionid 0e641138-90e8-1234-bacc-c7e0b3c8d8aa \
--workspace workspace-name \
--resourcegroup rg-test \
--purgeid purge-97380f07-1235-4a21-8ff7-cc092303662a
